# App for the organization of your most valuable sources of inspiration

This application let users save a reference to books, films and works of art they are interested in. This is made possible by the data provided by several public APIs:

- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/),
- [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York)](https://metmuseum.github.io/).

The ultimate purpose is offering a place where you can collect all your favourite and most inspiring resources.

I'll be very glad to recive any comment or review!
